          <h2>1. Sri Lankan Leopard(Panthera pardus kotiya) </h2>
          <br>
         <article class="paragraph">
          
          
         <p> This is a leopard subspecies found only in Sri Lanka.
           This leopard has a tawny to rusty yellow-colored coat with rosettes that are smaller than that of the Indian leopards.
           Males of this subspecies often weigh as much as 100 kg. You can spot them in national parks such as Yala National Park andWilpattu National Park<br><br>

           Since 2008, the Sri Lankan leopard has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. 
           The wild population is roughly estimated at 700–950 individuals as of 2015. The Sri Lankan 
           leopard has a tawny or rusty yellow coat with dark spots and close-set rosettes, which are smaller than in Indian leopards.<br>
          
           The Sri Lankan leopard has evolved to become a rather large leopard subspecies with 
           very large males reaching almost 220 lb (100 kg), due to the fact that it is an apex predator 
           without competition by other large wild cat species in the country

      <h2 class="subtitle">2. Srilankan Elephant (Elephas maximus maximus)</h2>
      <article class="paragraph">
       <p>The Sri Lankan elephant is the largest subspecies of the Asian elephant and is native to Sri Lanka. 
        These elephants have a restricted habitat confined to the dry zone in Sri Lanka’s north, east, and southeast.<br><br>

        With a shoulder height of between 2 and 3.5 meters (6.6 and 11.5 feet) and weighing between 2,000 and 5,500 kilograms 
        (4,400 and 12,100 pounds). They have 19 pairs of ribs and their skin color is darker than that of other subspecies, 
        with larger and more distinct patches of depigmentation on their ears, face, trunk, and belly. <br><br>
        
        Only 7% of males bear tusks, which can grow up to 6 feet long and weigh up to 35 kilograms (77 pounds). 
        Sri Lanka has the highest density of elephants in Asia, and they are present in several national parks, 
        including Udawalawe National Park, Yala National Park, Lunugamvehera National Park, Wilpattu National Park, 
        and Minneriya National Park. However, human-elephant conflict is increasing due to the conversion of elephant
         habitat to settlements and permanent cultivation.

    <h2>3. Toque Macaque(Macaca sinica)</h2>
      <article class="paragraph">
       <p>The toque macaque is a primate endemic to Sri Lanka. They live in groups of 8 to 40 members
         and have a broad diet consisting of flowers, fruits, grains, etc. These monkeys have a highly restricted
          habitat limited to the island of Sri Lanka and are threatened by habitat destruction, hunting, and capture for the pet trade<br><br>

          The toque macaque is a reddish-brown-coloured Old World monkey endemic to Sri Lanka, 
          where it is known as the rilewa or rilawa. Its name refers to the whorl of hair at the crown of the head,
           reminiscent of a brimless toque cap. The toque macaque is the smallest species of Macaca and is listed as endangered by IUCN and in CITES Appendix II.<br><br>
           
           They are diurnal herbivores and can grow up to 480 mm. 
           ocial status is highly structured in toque macaque troops and dominance hierarchies occur among both males and females.
            A troop may consist of eight to forty individuals, and the young offspring of a troop’s alpha female will typically 
            receive better sustenance and shelter than their peers. There are three recognized subspecies of toque macaques: Macaca sinica sinica, dry zone toque macaque or common toque macaque; Macaca sinica aurifrons, wet zone toque macaque or pale-fronted toque macaque; and Macaca sinica opisthomelas, highland toque macaque or hill zone toque macaque <br><br>

         (Axis axis ceylonessis) is a subspecies of the Axis Deer, also known as the Chital Deer. <br><br>

          The Sri Lankan Axis Deer is not considered to be endangered, but their population is declining due to habitat loss and hunting . <br><br>
